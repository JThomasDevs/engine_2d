GAME ENGINE REQUIREMENTS & COMPONENTS
=====================================

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
- Build a game with the engine simultaneously (don't build abstractly)
- Clone a simple game (puzzle, battleships, blackjack) to test APIs
- Discover and fix design flaws early through practical use

CORE REQUIREMENTS (Basic 2D Engine):
====================================

1. COMMON ELEMENTS:
   - Vector / Point
   - Matrix
   - Color
   - Other mathematical utilities

2. AUDIO SYSTEM:
   - Sound playback
   - Audio management

3. GRAPHICS SYSTEM:
   - Textured / untextured quads (with / without lighting)
   - Polylines / beams
   - Debug lines / boxes / circles / grids
   - Text rendering
   - Particle systems
   - Streaks

4. FILE SYSTEM:
   - Resource loading
   - Asset management

5. COLLISION SYSTEM:
   - Collision detection
   - Physics bodies

6. WINDOW MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:
   - Window creation
   - Event handling
   - Context management

7. INPUT HANDLING:
   - Keyboard input
   - Mouse input
   - Gamepad input

ADVANCED FEATURES (Game-Dependent):
==================================

1. ANIMATION:
   - Sprite animation
   - Tweening
   - Animation frameworks

2. MODELS / ENTITIES / AGENTS:
   - Entity-Component-System (ECS)
   - Game object management

3. SCRIPTING / EVENT SYSTEMS:
   - Custom scripting
   - Event-driven architecture

4. UI WIDGETS:
   - User interface components
   - Menu systems

5. WORLD / SCENE MANAGEMENT:
   - Scene transitions
   - Level management

6. PATHFINDING:
   - AI navigation
   - Route planning

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
=======================
- Start with core requirements
- Build a simple game to test each system
- Add advanced features based on game needs
- Iterate and refine based on practical usage
